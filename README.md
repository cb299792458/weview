## Overview
WeView is a video hosting and streaming platform with a focus on education. Teachers can upload videos, and students can watch them anywhere, anytime. While they watch, students can leave comments, but unlike YouTube, where comments appear at the bottom of the video, WeView comments are timestamped, and by default will appear at the same time in the video that they were made. This feature replicates the interactivity of a live lesson on Zoom without the need for all the students to be watching concurrently. Students can ask and answer questions right in the browser as they watch, or turn them off if they find it distracting.

## Special Features

#### Modal Account Management
WeView has a fully functioning account management and User Authentication System. A modal login menu is used to allow users to signup, login, or logout while watching a video without losing their progress. Logging in, signing up, and updating your account all actually use the same modal window, which changes based on context.
